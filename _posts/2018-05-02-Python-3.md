  <tr>
    <td>I stayed really focused during the lesson which allowed me to progress a good amount during the lesson, I got stuck on one or two questions but I asked for help after trying myself and I got progressed further.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td> Sometimes when I got something wrong I got quite frustrated instead of staying calm and trying to solve the problem sensibly. This limited my progression, although I did eventually solve the problems I was faced with.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will stay calm and focused to maximise my progression next lesson. Also I will remember the methods for python and use them next week.</td>
