    <td>I was doing much harder questions, this meant that I had to be a lot more thoughtful about what code I was,writing. Also Using previous knowledge was really helpful.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was giving up quite easily when I got something wrong, instead of trying myself I would ask for help straight away. This meant I didn't fully understand the code I was doing.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will be more independent In my learning, If I get stuck then I will persevere to find the right answer instead of asking someone else. This will help me understand the code better.</td>
