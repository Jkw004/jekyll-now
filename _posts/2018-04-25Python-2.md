(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>it was helpful to think back to all the specific techniques that are useful. Also when I was struggling, thinking of it in normal logic terms is very helpful because sometimes all the code can get confusing.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn't ask when I needed help, I was really stuck but I just continued on my home, this limited my progress and learning. If I had asked someone do help then I would’ve been able to understand it and move on with python.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will ask for help, but only when I am really stuck and have tried everything I can think of. If I don’t I won’t be able to progress the way I would like to.</td>
