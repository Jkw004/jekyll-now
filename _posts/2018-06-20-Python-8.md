    <td>Brainstorming was really effective because it got everyone's ideas and put in to one so we could begin to figure it out. Understanding the logic is really helpful to then start to understand the code behind it.</td>

    <td>at some points in the lesson we got a bit off topic and talked about football, this was not relevant to the lesson and stopped some of our learning(however it was fun)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>going forward with python I will use the brainstorming method to help understand the logic so it is then easier to write the code.</td>
