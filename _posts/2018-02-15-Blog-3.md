blog 3

I worked with Abid and piers to continue through the booklet, we were making a number guessing game! We completed the task but it took longer than we thought because we accidently deleted it halfway through. We worked well together and also go some time to work on our github. This allowed me to make improvements on my layout of the blogs. I think that we could of done more if we worked harder and didn't delete it.
