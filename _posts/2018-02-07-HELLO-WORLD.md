HELLO WORLD

Today we had a cover lesson, I worked with piers and abid to achieve the task. The task was to use the fuze box editor to create a code that spreads hello world all over the screen. We then started playing around with writing different messages and have them move across the screen at different speeds. In this lesson I think that I worked well with my group, we got the task done and concentrated well. To improve I think we could have tried to start moving on to more complicated things by working through the book.
