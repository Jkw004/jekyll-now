Target.                                    

 To understand how to do def cards.

Did I achieve it?                      

Yes because we finished laying out the pixels and    

 started to code it in.

What helped me learn?          

 I used the manual to understand what to do, if I       

  was still confused then I would ask someone to explain.

  I also worked well with my group.

                                               

What limited my learning?      

I think I could of had more concentration on the task         

Because I was often getting distracted. Also at the start 

 It took us a while to get the fuze box working.

What habits do I need

To work on?

  I need to be quicker at getting the fuze box working                                                         At the start. Also I should try and be more concentrated.
