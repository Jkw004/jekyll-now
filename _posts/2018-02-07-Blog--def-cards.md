Target.                                     To understand how to do def cards.

Did I achieve it?                      Yes because we finished laying out the pixels and    

                                                Started to code it in.

What helped me learn?           I used the manual to understand what to do, if I       

                                                was still confused then I would ask someone to explain.

                                              I also worked well with my group.

                                               

What limited my learning?      I think I could of had more concentration on the task         

                                               Because I was often getting distracted. Also at the start  

                                               It took us a while to get the fuze box working.

What habits do I need.          I need to be quicker at getting the fuze box working

To improve on?                    At the start. Also I should try and be more concentrated.
