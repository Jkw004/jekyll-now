    <td>Reading how the instructions are worded is really helpful as it will give you clues and information on how to complete the coding. Also the grey boxes are really helpful as they include some bits of code that are necessary for the task. </td>

    <td>I started to rely too heavily on the grey boxes, sometimes they mislead me and I got it wrong. There was other pieces of code that I needed, I needed to use what I had already learnt.</td>
